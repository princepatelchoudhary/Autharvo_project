# Linear Regression Practice Notebook

## Purpose
This notebook is designed for educational purposes, particularly for a data engineer with limited data science knowledge. It introduces the concept of linear regression and implements it in a practical example.

## Key Sections

### 1. **Introduction to Linear Regression**
   - **Concept:** Linear regression models the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
   - **Dependent Variable:** The value we aim to predict.
   - **Independent Variable(s):** The feature(s) used to predict the dependent variable.
   - **Key Purposes:**
     - **Coefficients:** Measure the direction (positive/negative) and magnitude of the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
     - **Equation:** Allows predicting the dependent variable based on given values of independent variables.

### 2. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - **R-squared (RÂ²):** Describes the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s). Ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** The average squared differences between the actual and predicted values, used to evaluate model accuracy.

### 3. **Code Implementation**
   The notebook contains code that performs the following tasks:
   - **Data Loading:** The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
   - **Data Splitting:** The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
   - **Model Training:** A linear regression model is trained using the training set, utilizing the `LinearRegression` model from `scikit-learn`.
   - **Model Evaluation:** The model is evaluated on the test set using R-squared and MSE.
   - **Visualization:** Plots are generated to visualize the linear relationship and model predictions.

### 4. **Data Description**
   The notebook includes a statistical summary of the dataset used in the regression analysis. This includes key statistics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and percentiles for each variable.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
   - `numpy`
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scikit-learn`

Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
